## Getting the chance to try out my skills as a Web Developer.


This website was a chance to test my skills as a newly trained web developer. I'm sure I will look back on this version of the website one day and want to change the entire code. For now, I'm proud of this website. I built this website from scratch and tried to incorporate any fancy tricks known as of now. Almost everything is clickable, and after you click items in the nav bar you will be automatically directed to that section of the website. All of my recent projects are integrated into the site. You can visit them with the click of a button. Also, if you click the email at the bottom of the page, it will automatically pull up an email to contact me.  Sadly creativity is not my strong suit. So please forgive the crude style on my page. I promise all who visit this website. It will look better as my skills progress. Thank you for visiting
